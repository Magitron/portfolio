        <p><b>I design user friendly experiences for apps</b> using an iterative process of user research, ideation, sketchboarding, wireframing, and prototyping. Using the brand’s persona and experience guidelines, I create the visual design to suit the motivation, emotion, and story of the experience.</p>

        <p><b>I code the the interface</b> by building out designs and interactions, coding semantic and accessible markup, building responsive layouts, and creating reusable components. I am excited by working on a team with other enthusiastic developers to collaboratively solve problems and build a high quality product together. </p>

        <p>While I love to grow in my design skills, and I love to design on my free time, my professional services focus on user experience or user interface design for mobile or web applications only.
        That means I am not looking for work on static web sites, content creation, basic logo designs, or illustration or graphic design. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box md work-right">
        <p>On my free time I may create a side project from the ground up, however my professional services don’t include any form of backend development, hosting setup, or subscription, analytics, or wordpress setups. That means I don’t work on static web sites, coding platforms like squarespace or others, or wordpress themes.
